# **`Netflix Data Analysis Using python and Jupyter`**

I performed a comprehensive analysis of my Netflix data using Python. To begin with, I undertook several data transformations, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), addressing null values, describing the data, examining its shape, inspecting data types, and identifying the count of unique data points. Within these transformations, I executed a series of steps:

## **`Steps`**

Checked for the presence of null values in each column and visualized this using a heatmap.
Subsequently, I commenced the primary transformations aimed at deriving meaningful insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn, as highlighted below:
- For the show "Zozo":
Retrieved the Show Case Id and identified the Director of the show.
- I then proceeded to identify:
The year with the highest number of releases for both TV shows and movies.
- Following this, I:
Converted the data type of the "Release_Date" column to datetime format.
- Furthermore, I generated visualizations to showcase:
The count of movies and TV shows using a bar graph.
- Next, I filtered and displayed:
All the movies that were released in the year 2010.
The titles of TV shows exclusively released in Pakistan.
- I compiled a list of:
The top 10 Directors who contributed the most to Netflix in terms of TV shows and movies.
- Additionally, I presented records that met the criteria:
Category is "Movie" and type is either "Horror Movies" or country is "United Kingdom".
- To provide insights into content rating, I outlined:
The various rating categories defined by Netflix.
- Moreover, I calculated:
The maximum duration of a TV show on Netflix.
- To organize the dataset chronologically, I demonstrated:
How to sort the dataset by year.
Overall, this analysis encompassed data exploration, data transformation, visualization, and extraction of valuable insights, shedding light on the diverse aspects of the Netflix dataset.
